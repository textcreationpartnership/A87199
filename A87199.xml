            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And his policy to escape from being found out in these his Trayterous enterprizes, did labour by all the meanes he could to stop Parliamentary proceedings, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the rights thereof.</p>
            <p>This Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> also conspired with the late Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to bring in an Army from <hi>Jreland,</hi> to subdue the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> which Trayterous fact, should all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Chronologies of times be searcht, is not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd in any age, had that wicked intent of theirs taken
<pb facs="tcp:157092:3"/>effect, which makes me view the Records amongst the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Spirits, to find it matcht, there I might extenuate their facts, where first he appeares like the false spirit, sent into the mouth of the Prophets of <hi>Achab,</hi> to speake delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to subvert the Host of God.</p>
            <p>Nor must I stay here to accuse him, but goe further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles which are exhibited against him.</p>
            <p>He joyned likewise with the late Earle, to take 80000 pounds out of the Exchequer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bought To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco therewith, and converted the profit to their owne uses.</p>
            <p>He alsoo cuntenanced Papists. and yeelded to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Monasteryes, to alienate the affections of the <hi>Irish,</hi> from the subjection of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he Confederated to draw the subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the King.</p>
            <p>Let this man be judged according to his acts, cry the Commonalty of <hi>Jreland,</hi> also the Commons of <hi>England</hi> are of the same opinion. It is a common maxime in these times, for men to doe what they can, to enjoy greatnesse let goodnesse seeke entertainement where it will, <hi>Victa Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet pietas, probitas laudatur &amp;c.</hi> Piety alas: it is hard to be found, honesty is C≈çmended, but few give it acceptance. Jn what a miserable condition are all those, who strive to be great, and not good, was it not the case of Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe,</hi> who now for his liberty (I am perswaded) would exchange his dignity, for to whom much is given, much will be required, J have heard many, who having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the crymes afore-mentioned, committed by this <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> (for so may J tearme him) ready to curse him, which is Jmpiety, for wee ought rather to pray for our Enemies. Neither was he alone the sole actor, in the forenamed Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, for he was assisted by Sir <hi>Richard Bolton</hi> Knight, Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland, Iohn</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:157092:4"/>and Sir <hi>Gerrard Lowther</hi> Knight, Lord chiefe Justice of his Majesties Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> who are likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of the said Facts.</p>

            <p>J must confesse, that <hi>humanum est errare,</hi> and the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes writs of errour, and arrests of judgement, but where there is <hi>crassa ignorantia,</hi> against their Oathes, and knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, nay where it is rather <hi>praemedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta malitia,</hi> an emulating policy, seeking onely to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a Nationall destruction, as if their safety were onely involved in our Ruine, there J must pity, but not excuse them, Innovations in Law, and so consequently in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, creepe in like Heresies in Religion, slowly and slily pleading, and in the end a sawcy and corrupt Legitimacy by uncontrouled prescription.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:157092:4"/>put in him, to persecute both with rigour and wicked me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, his unjust and illegall commands, which (if plously and justly given, &amp; vertuously addicted) would have beene an eternall monument, of glory and happinesse, but the children of this world, are onely wise in their conceits, and where falsity and injustice is upholden, how can equity florish.</p>
            <p>I am forced to cry out, <hi>O Ratcliffe, Ratcliffe,</hi> thou didst seeke rather to obey thy master but a Viceroy, or <hi>Debuty</hi> King, then the King himselfe, and by so doing, didst thou violate the lawes of that unhappy Kingdome, (by the and thy complices made so) for which now there is nothing left unto the, but shame and repentance.</p>
            <p>what glasse hath this unhappy devided Kingdome, from his Majesties prefence and audience to contemplate the faire &amp; ravishing forme of his royall intentions in, but in the cleare and diaphanous Administration of his Justice, and what doe these Trayterous and Jllegall practises aime at, but in Affront to his Majestie, and discontent to his subjects, to multiply as by a magicke glasse, the royall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of his favours into the ugly &amp; deformed usage of their suppression of the liberties, devastation of estates, and deprivation of his Loyall Subjects, so that it may be said, <hi>Regali capiti cervicem consul equinam jungere sic vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let varias{que} inducere plumas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jn conclusion, all that J can say, is this, that hee which but lately (Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> J meane) lived so Tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, and in Pompe, is now but <hi>Civiliter mortuus,</hi> for his answer speedily must be put into the Articles, now in the High Court of Parliament exhibited against him, that further proceedings may be expedited, as may be sutable to Justice, and the prefidents of Parliaments, to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty appeare in his magnificent goodnesse, and indulgency to his people, that his people may bee ravished in their
<pb facs="tcp:157092:5"/>their dutifull obedience and loyalty to his Majestie.</p>
            <p>So shall this Parliament, live in records to Posterity, as the instrumentall reformers of these corrupted times, and that the Kingdome and Common-wealth, may pay an amiable Sacrifice in retribution and acknowledgement of his Majesties multiplied providence, for our preservation herein, to this J know, all but Trayters both to King and Countrey, will with an unanimous consent say <hi>Amen.</hi>
